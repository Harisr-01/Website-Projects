Backend part that connects to MONGODB database and uses HTTP method routes so that public users can 
make, read, update, and delete database entries. Also has JWT authentication for each route by
utilzing tokens and authorization. Public users would need to send thier login credentials stored
in MONGODB database and use the token codes they are given once they are loggged in to make, update,
and delete data. Without logins and using the tokens these actions cannot happen.
